# Manipulation of Data Set 

# Question 1 
“How has the number of houses bought in each wealth class changed over the years?”

We created a calculated field that categorizes properties into Lower, Lower-Middle, Upper-Middle, and Upper Class based on the quartiles determined from a box-and-whisker plot in Tableau.

# Question 1 
“How has the number of houses bought in each wealth class changed over the years?”

We created a calculated field that categorizes properties into Lower, Lower-Middle, Upper-Middle, and Upper Class based on the quartiles determined from a box-and-whisker plot in Tableau.

# Question 2 
How have year-over-year growth rates in median home sale prices varied across different neighborhoods from 2001 to 2022, and which neighborhoods experienced the most significant growth or decline following the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic?
